# 42 Málaga - C++ Modules

## Overview
This repository contains all the C++ modules and exercises that I am completing as part of the 42 Málaga curriculum (Fundación Telefónica).  
Each module is organized in its own folder (e.g., `M_00`, `M_01`), with subfolders for each exercise.

## Modules and Exercises

### Module 00 - Basics of C++
- **ex00 - Megaphone:**  
  Create a program that outputs arguments in uppercase, simulating shouting.  
- **ex01 - My Awesome PhoneBook:**  
  Implement a simple phonebook with contact management using classes and no dynamic memory allocation.  
- **ex02 - The Job Of Your Dreams:**  
  Recreate the missing `Account.cpp` source file to manage bank accounts with logging.

### Module 01 - Memory allocation, pointers to members, references and switch statements
- **ex00 - BraiiiiiiinnnzzzZ:**
  Learn about pointers and memory addresses by creating zombie objects and managing them dynamically.

- **ex01 - Moar brainz!:**
  Improve your zombie army by adding brain damage functionality and proper constructors/destructors.

- **ex02 - HI THIS IS BRAIN:**
  Understand references, pointers, and dereferencing by implementing functions that manipulate data using references.

- **ex03 - Unnecessary violence:**
  Handle advanced pointer usage and dynamic memory in a battle simulation with zombies.

- **ex04 - Sed is for losers:**
  Write a program that performs string replacements in files, practicing file I/O and string manipulation.

- **ex05 - Harl 2.0:**
  Create a class Harl with private complaint levels (debug, info, warning, error) and a public complain method. Use pointers to member functions and avoid large if/else blocks.

- **ex06 - Harl filter:**
  Extend the previous exercise by implementing a filter system. Given a level, print all complaints at that level and above. Use a switch statement for control flow and handle unknown levels gracefully.

## How to Use
- Each exercise contains its own `Makefile` and source files.  
- Navigate to the exercise folder and run `make` to build the program.  
- Follow the exercise-specific README files for usage instructions.

## Notes
- Code style and norms follow the 42 school requirements.  
- No forbidden functions unless specified in exercise descriptions.  
- Aim for clean, maintainable, and well-commented code.
