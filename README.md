# 42 Málaga - C++ Modules

## Overview
This repository contains all the C++ modules and exercises that I am completing as part of the 42 Málaga curriculum (Fundación Telefónica).  
Each module is organized in its own folder (e.g., `M_00`, `M_01`), with subfolders for each exercise.

## Structure
```

## Modules and Exercises

### Module 00 - Basics of C++
- **ex00 - Megaphone:**  
  Create a program that outputs arguments in uppercase, simulating shouting.  
- **ex01 - My Awesome PhoneBook:**  
  Implement a simple phonebook with contact management using classes and no dynamic memory allocation.  
- **ex02 - The Job Of Your Dreams:**  
  Recreate the missing `Account.cpp` source file to manage bank accounts with logging.

### Future Modules
- Will include more advanced topics and exercises following the 42 curriculum.

## How to Use
- Each exercise contains its own `Makefile` and source files.  
- Navigate to the exercise folder and run `make` to build the program.  
- Follow the exercise-specific README files for usage instructions.

## Notes
- Code style and norms follow the 42 school requirements.  
- No forbidden functions unless specified in exercise descriptions.  
- Aim for clean, maintainable, and well-commented code.
