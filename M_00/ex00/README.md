- If no arguments are given, output:  
  `* LOUD AND UNBEARABLE FEEDBACK NOISE *`
- Example usage:
  ```bash
  $ ./megaphone "hello world"
  HELLO WORLD
  ```

## Files to submit
- Makefile
- megaphone.cpp

## Notes
- No forbidden functions for this exercise.
- The solution must be implemented using C++ language features and best practices.
