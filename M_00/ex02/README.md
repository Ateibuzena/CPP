# Exercise 02: The Job Of Your Dreams

## Description
In this exercise, you recreate the missing `Account.cpp` file for a banking application.

The program simulates bank accounts with logging features and various account operations.  
You will implement the `Account` class based on the header file `Account.hpp` and a provided log file.

## Requirements
- Implement all member functions declared in `Account.hpp`.
- The program will be tested using `tests.cpp`, which simulates account creation, deposits, withdrawals, and displays logs.
- Match the output format shown in the provided log file (timestamps can differ).

## Files to submit
- `Makefile`
- `Account.cpp`
- `Account.hpp`
- `tests.cpp`

## Notes
- No forbidden functions for this exercise.
- Pay attention to constructors, destructors, static members, and const correctness.
- Use C++ best practices to ensure clean and maintainable code.
