# Exercise 01: My Awesome PhoneBook

## Description
This project is a simple phonebook application inspired by 1980s technology.  
The program allows the user to add, search, and display contacts with specific constraints:

- The phonebook stores up to 8 contacts. Adding a 9th contact replaces the oldest one.
- Contacts contain the following fields: first name, last name, nickname, phone number, and darkest secret.
- Dynamic memory allocation is forbidden.
- User commands:
  - `ADD`: Add a new contact.
  - `SEARCH`: Display a list of contacts and view detailed information.
  - `EXIT`: Quit the program.

## Implementation details
- Two classes must be implemented: `PhoneBook` and `Contact`.
- Data encapsulation: private attributes and public methods.
- Input validation to avoid empty fields.
- Formatting output to display a table of contacts with fixed-width columns.

## Files to submit
- `Makefile`
- All `.cpp` and `.hpp`/`.h` files related to the implementation.

## Notes
- Follow C++ conventions and good coding style.
- Watch the module intranet videos for additional guidance.
